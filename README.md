For downloading Landsat images from Google Earth Engine- Use /satellite/get-all-africa-10km-images-script_country.py. You will require a csv file containing locations. 

For the contrastive learning setup- Use /Pretraining/contrastive_10_04.py. Extract feature vector embeddings for each image using /Pretraining/extract_features_full_5k_10k.py. We do not provide the dataset here. Available on request. 

For the Bayesian model and realisations- Use /Predictions/0904_baseline_FINAL.r. 

For conversion of prevalence rates to incidence rates- Use /Predictions/summarize_baseline.r. 

For final plotting- Use /Predictions/final_incidence_average_cases_mapping copy.ipynb.

Supllementary plots were generated using /Extras/obsvpred.ipynb and /Extras/regression_evi.ipynb.

Please note that we do not provide data here. The images can be made available on request. The DHS and MAP data require data controller agreements and thus cannot be shared. However, they have been shared with the editor.
